# About RangeSociety

Around 98% of all single-trip journeys in the US are 50 miles or less in length. Despite the fact that almost all available EV’s have a range that exceeds 50 miles, many people don’t buy, consider, or use EV’s. We’re here to help change that, and to help current EV owners. Our app will help you find things to do within your EV’s range, and to top it off, we’ll help you find an EV charger near the place you’re going so you can charge up while you’re there. Once you’ve arrived to your destination or back home, you can log your trip on your dashboard, and see how much tailpipe carbon emissions you saved.

## Learning Goals

* Understanding how to build a full Rails app from idea to delivery
* Revisiting previous concepts such as APIs and OAuth
* Finding the strengths and gaps in knowledge of Ruby, Rails, and organizing a project.
* Using an agile process as features are developed
* Configure a continuous integration server (We used `Travis CI`)

## Getting Started && Prerequisites

### Implementing OAuth

* Google OAuth requirements:
  Sign up for Google OAuth, receive a client id and secret defined within as `ENV['CLIENT_ID']` & `ENV['CLIENT_SECRET']`

###### API Keys Required:

* Yelp defined within as `ENV['YELP_API_KEY']`
* Mapbox defined within as `ENV['MAPBOX_KEY']`
* Nrel defined within as `ENV['NREL_API_KEY']`

You will need Rails v 5.2.2.

## Testing

Your location should be the root directory of the project (`Range_society`).

From the command line run `rspec`
(This can take a moment)

`Green` is passing.
`Red` is failing.

We used `rspec`, `capybara`, `launchy`, `vcr`, `shoulda-matchers`, and `simplecov` for testing.
